"Did doctor Tulp pay the most, because he was the most important? Yes, Dr. Tulp probably paid the most. The most important sitters, who got the best places in group portraits, usually paid more than others.",People
"Do you also know the names of all men in the painting? Yes, the names of all men in the painting are known. In the 18th century, someone wrote down their names on the piece of paper held by the man at Dr Tulp's left and put a corresponding number next to the head of every man. During the conservation of the painting in 1997-1998, these names were removed in order to reveal the original anatomical illustration underneath, which is still visible today.",People
How did this man die? The man was hanged as a convicted criminal. Only corpses of convicted criminals could be used in anatomy lessons.,People
What is the man in purple looking at? The man in purple is looking attentively at the action Dr. Tulp performs with the pliers in his left hand.,People
"Do you know whether these are all portraits of real people? Yes, these are all portraits of real people. The men commissioned Rembrandt to be depicted in this painting.",People
"Do we also know the names of the people? Yes, we do know the names of the people. In the 18th century, someone wrote down their names on the piece of paper which is being held by the man at Dr Tulp's left. During the conservation of the painting in 1997-1998, these names were removed in order to reveal the original anatomical illustration underneath, which is still visible today.",People
"Is it right that the corpse came from a prisoner? Yes, that's right. This was the corpse of Aris Kindt, a thief who had received the death sentence because he was an habitual offender. He was hanged on 31 January 1632.",People
"Who are these people in the painting? The men depicted in this painting are surgeons, attending an anatomy lesson by Dr Tulp. Their names are known because in the 18th century they were written down on the piece of paper held by the man at Dr Tulp's right. During the conservation of the painting in 1997-1998, these names were removed in order to reveal the original anatomical illustration underneath, which is still visible today. The identity of the corpse is known too. His name was Adriaan Adriaanszoon, a.k.a. Aris Kindt, a criminal from Leiden. He got the death penalty on January 31st 1632.",People

"Who was it? Who was the corpse? The deceased man was Adriaan Adriaanszoon from Leiden, known as Aris Kindt. He had been sentenced for theft multiple times. His latest crime was violently stealing a coat, for which he was hanged. His corpse was subsequently made available to science.",People
"Did he authorize to be dissected during an anatomy lesson? It was common practice to use the corpes of convicted criminals for anatomy lessons such as this one, and Aris Kindt  was probably not asked for authorisation.",People
Why did they choose him? There were probably more people who committed the same crimes. A dissection could only take place on a fresh corps. The body of Aris Kindt must therefore have been chosen as his body was still fresh from the execution.,People
"Was doctor Tulp the head of the guild? No, he was not. Dr Tulp was not a barber surgeon, but a physician. Holding a university degree, his theoretical extertion was deemed superior to the manual activity the barber surgeon's practiced at the time. Dr Tulp was appointed by the Amsterdam city council in order to be employed by the Amsterdam surgeon's guild as a 'praelector anatomiae' or 'reader of anatomy'. This meant that he was the only one in the city who was authorized to teach anatomy while dissecting the human body.",People
"Why are the people not looking at the hand? What are they all looking at? Rembrandt depicted the men looking in different directions in order to create a dynamic and exciting composition. The man in front is looking at the book, while the man in purple pays attention to the dissected hand. Others look at the book or at Dr. Tulp. Rembrandt depicted two men looking at the viewer, in order to engage us with the painting.",People
"The man in the back with the tray, is he making notes? The man in the back is holding his notebook, on which two studies of a dissected arm are depicted. In the 18th century all names of the men in the painting were written on it.",People

Holding a university degree, his theoretical extertion was deemed superior to the manual activity the barber surgeon's practiced. Dr Tulp was employed by the Amsterdam surgeon's guild as a 'praelector anatomiae' or 'reader of anatomy'. This meant that he was the only one who was authorized to teach anatomy and dissect the human body.",People
"Who paid the most? Dr. Tulp must have paid the most money to be depicted in this painting, since he was given de most prominent position.",People
"Are these students who are being trained? The men attending Dr Tulp's lesson were all practicing barber surgeons who performed a wide-range of procedures. Among them were bloodletting, cupping, extracting teeth, performing surgery and cutting hair. The barber surgeons of Amsterdam received theory lessons twice a week, led by a prominent doctor with a university degree. As part of these lessons, they attended the annual anatomy lesson.",People
Who is standing there? This question is not clear. Could you be more specific?,People
Which doctor is that? This question is not clear. Could you be more specific?,People
"Are these all medics? Yes, they are. However, there is a difference in their practices. Dr Tulp had received a university degree and was, as a doctor, practicing an intellectual craft. The men surrounding him are barber surgeons: medical practitioners who were commonly trained through apprenticeships. They performed manual crafts such as bloodletting, cupping, extracting teeth, performing surgery and cutting hair.",People
"Who was doctor Tulp? Dr. Tulp was quite a famous doctor at the time. Born Claes Pieterszoon, he studied medicine in Leiden, after which he returned to Amsterdam where he became a respected doctor. He adopted the tulip as his heraldric emblem and changed his name to Nicolaes (a more proper version of the name Claes) Tulp. In 1628, Tulp was appointed Praelector Anatomiae of the surgeon's guild, which meant that he was the only person allowed to teach the anatomy of the human body. Besides being a doctor, he was also a politician and even became Mayor of Amsterdam.",People
"Wat is a barber surgeon? Did they start as normal barbers? Barber surgeons were medical practitioners who performed a wide-range of procedures. Among them were bloodletting, cupping, extracting teeth, performing surgery and cutting hair. They were commonly trained through apprenticeships. The difference between a barber surgeon and a doctor, such as Dr Tulp, was that the former was seen as performing a manual craft, while the latter an intellectual.",People

Why does Nicolaes Tulp make a certain movement with his hand? Dr Tulp demonstrates the hand movement that would occur when pulling the muscles in the forearm.,People
"Do the guild members represent real medical students? Werent they too old? The men surrounding Dr Tulp were all members of the Amsterdam Surgeon's Guild. They were not, however, real medical students as we know them now.

"Arent these people too old to be studying or didnt that matter at that time? The men in the painting were very different from medical students as we know them today. They were barber surgeons, who were held in a different regard than physicians, like Dr Tulp. Tulp held a university degree and thus practiced an intellectual craft. Barber surgeons, however, practiced a manual craft. They were medical practitioners who performed a wide-range of procedures such as bloodletting, extracting teeth, performing surgery and cutting hair. They did not go to university but were commonly trained through apprenticeships that often took years. Attending anatomy lessons, which took place once a year, was an opportunity to gain some more knowledge.",People
"Did all people in this painting really exist? Yes, the men in the painting did all exist. Their names are still known today.",People
"Why does the man in the middle of the painting with a sheet in his hand looks so terrified? It seems as if he is caught or wants to flee. That is an interesting interpretation. It has also been interpreted as if this man is paying close attention. Rembrandt depicted him looking up to the viewer, in order to invite the viewer to participate in the lesson.",People
"Why do some people look away from the body? Rembrandt depicted the men looking in different directions in order to create a dynamic and interactive composition. By following the different lines of sight, the viewer gains a good understanding of what is going on. All men are paying close attention: one looks at the dissected arm, while others look at the book in the lower right corner.

"One of the people in the middle is looking upwards. What is he looking at? The man holding the notebook in the middle, at left of Dr Tulp, looks straight at the viewer. This little trick was often used by painters at the time in order to let the painting interact with the viewer.",People
"Why is that person looking at me? That man is looking at you in order to engage the viewer with the painting. By depicting figures that make eye contact with the spectator, Rembrandt invites the viewer to interact with the painting and to take part in the anatomy lesson, as it were. This was a trick that was commonly used by painters at the time.",People

What is Dr. Tulp doing? Dr. Tulp has dissected the arm of the corpse and teaches the anatomy of the arm to the men attending his lesson.,People
"Did the knowledge gained by an anatomy lesson transfer to the medical world at that time? Yes, it did.

He gave classes in the theory of anatomy twice a week to trainee surgeons. The public dissections were supplementary to these classes and were held far less frequently, around once a year.",Anatomy
"Did they always start first with the hand? No, they did not usually start with the hand. With the process of bodily decomposition in mind,  the dissection would usually start with the most perishable body parts, such as the stomach and intestines. The arm would be dealt with during a later stage of the anatomy lesson, which often took three days. Instead of painting the corpse's torso cut open, however, Rembrandt chose to depict only the dissection of the left arm, presumably to make the painting more attractive to look at.",Anatomy
"Why specifically that person? Why was he dissected? Te deceased person was chosen to be dissected, as he was a convicted criminal who was hanged on the same day the anatomy lesson took place. His name was Adriaan Adriaanszoon from Leiden, known as Aris Kindt. A notorious thief, his latest crime was violently stealing a coat, for which he was hanged. His corpse was subsequently made available to science.",Anatomy
"Why are that many people attending this autopsy? Rembrandt depicted seven men attending Dr Tulp's anatomy lesson. In reality, however, there would have been many more visitors, as a public anatomy lesson was a major event in seventeenth-century Amsterdam. For a fee, anyone could attend. The men depicted by Rembrandt paid him to be included in the painting.",Anatomy
"So, in that sense it was filthier than what you see here? Yes, it must have been filthier than what we see here. Rembrandt did not depict the dissections entirely veracious. With the process of bodily decomposition in mind,  the dissection would usually start with the most perishable body parts, such as the stomach and intestines. The arm would be dealt with during a later stage of the anatomy lesson. Instead of painting the corpe's torso cut open, Rembrandt chose to only depict the dissection of the left arm, presumably to make the painting more attractive.",Anatomy

"Was there also an audience? Yes,  the annual anatomy lessons were open for the public. However, one had to pay a fee to get it.",Anatomy
"Why is the anatomy lesson displayed in reversed order? Rembrandt presumably chose to depict only the dissection of the left arm in order to make the painting more attractive to look at. It is also thought to be a reference to the famous anatomist Andreas Vesalius, who published a groundbreaking book on the human anatomy in 1543. A portrait of Vesalius is included in the book, in which he is depicted while dissecting an arm.",Anatomy
"Was it legal to be dissected during an anatomy lesson? Yes, it was. In 1556 King Philip II had given the surgeon's guild permission to dissect the body of an executed criminal once a year.",Anatomy
"So it is the dissection of a corpse? Yes, this is a dissection of a corpse of an executed criminal.",Anatomy
"Is the anatomy lesson completely veracious? No, the anatomy lesson is not completely veracious. For example, a dissection would usually start with the most perishable body parts, such as the stomach and intestines. The arm would be dealt with during a later stage. Additionally, more people would have attended the lesson, and the background Rembrandt depicted does not represent the anatomical theatre.",Anatomy
"How regular a dissection of a dead human body was made? In 1556 King Philip II had given the surgeon's guild permission to dissect the body of an executed criminal once a year. The annual public anatomy lesson was typically held in winter, as cold temperatures would slow down the decomposition of the corpse.",Anatomy
"How unusual was it at that time to dissect a human body? The dissection of a the body of an executed criminal would usually happen only once a year. Because of this infrequency, the anual anatomy lesson attracted many spectators.",Anatomy

"How long had a person been dead before he was dissected? Aris Kindt was executed on January 31st 1632, the same day the anatomy lesson took place.",Anatomy
"Did you need a lot of money to attend such an anatomy lesson? The anatomy lessons that took place once a year were not only for the members of the guild, but they were open to the public. An entrance fee had to be paid, but it is not certain how high this fee was. As many people attended these anatomy lessons, it probably was not very expensive.",Anatomy
"And the guild was not accessible by the public, just by the doctors? The anatomy lessons that took place once a year were open to the public. An entrance fee had to be paid, but it is not certain how high this fee was. As many people attended these anatomy lessons, it probably was not very expensive.",Anatomy

"How did they acquire the corpse? The dead man on the table was Aris Kindt, a notorious criminal who had been executed  and whose body was used for dissection on that same day.",Anatomy
"Was it at that time accepted what is happening in the picture? Yes, this was a legal practice, but it did not happen on a regular basis. In 1556 King Philip II gave permission to the Amsterdam surgeon's guild to dissect the body of an executed criminal once a year.",Anatomy
"Was it common to have anatomy lessons? Yes, it was common to have anatomy lessons in the 17th century, but not on a regular basis. In 1556 King Philip II gave permission to the Amsterdam surgeon's guild to dissect the body of an executed criminal once a year.",Anatomy
"Was it shocking to depict people that were fully opened up? It is hard to say if it was shocking or not, but it certainly happened numerous times by Dutch artists during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Other examples are 'The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Willem van der Meer' of 1617 by Michiel en Pieter van Mierevelt, and the only remaining fragment of Rembrandt's 'Anatomy Lesson of Dr Jan Deijman' (1656) which shows a dissection of the brain.",Anatomy
"Was it allowed to dissect human corpses at that time? Yes, it was. In 1556 King Philip II had given the surgeon's guild permission to dissect the body of an executed criminal once a year.",Anatomy
"Did it take place in winter? Yes, it did. The annual public anatomy lesson was typically held in winter, as cold temperatures would slow down the decomposition of the corpse. That is also the case with Rembrandt's painting of Dr Tulp. On 31 January 1632 Aris Kindt was hanged as a criminal and his body was made available to the dissection of the surgeon's guild on that same day.",Anatomy
Were only corpses from criminals used for anatomy lessons? Yes. In 1556 King Philip II had given the surgeon's guild permission to dissect the body of an executed criminal once a year.,Anatomy

"So they just put somebody there and then perform the surgery? The man on the table is dead. He was known as Aris Kindt, a man who had committed multiple crimes and burglaries. Eventually he was hanged for violently attempting to steal a coat, after which his body was made available for the public dissection on that same day.",Anatomy
"Do there exist multiple paintings about the anatomy lesson? Yes, there are several more painted anatomy lessons by Dutch artists from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The earliest known Dutch painting of a dissection is 'The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Sebastiaen Egbertsz' by Aert Pietersz, dated 1601-1603.  One of the latest anatomy lessons was painted in 1758 by Tibout Regerts.",Anatomy
"Are there paintings where the corpse is completely opened? There are paintings and prints of anatomy lessons in which the torso of the body is opened up.

The only remaining fragment of Rembrandt's 'Anatomy Lesson of Dr Jan Deijman' (1656) shows a dissection of the brain.",Anatomy
"Why has only the arm been dissected here? With the process of bodily decomposition in mind,  the dissection would usually start with the most perishable body parts such as the stomach and intestines. The arm would be dealt with during a later stage of the anatomy lesson.
